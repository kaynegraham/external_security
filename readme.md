## Overview

External Bot was created in January 2024 to support FiveM communities that require a reliable, external Discord bot for managing users, commands, and server-related integrations.

The project focuses on simplicity, configurability, and real-world usage rather than experimental features. It is designed to run without a database and to integrate cleanly with FiveM server APIs where required.

## Features

- No database required
- Configuration-driven behaviour
- Discord.js v14 implementation
- FiveM server / API integration
- Multiple advanced moderation and utility commands

## Technical Overview

This project demonstrates:

- JavaScript (Node.js) backend development
- Discord.js v14 API usage
- Event-driven architecture
- External service integration

The codebase was written to be readable, extensible, and stable rather than overly abstract or experimental.
