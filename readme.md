## Overview

External Bot was created in January 2024 to support FiveM communities that require a reliable, external Discord bot for managing users, commands, and server-related integrations.

The project focuses on simplicity, configurability, and real-world usage rather than experimental features. It is designed to run without a database and to integrate cleanly with FiveM server APIs where required.

---

## Features

- No database required
- Configuration-driven behaviour
- Discord.js v14 implementation
- FiveM server / API integration
- Multiple advanced moderation and utility commands
- Designed for real community usage

---

## Technical Overview

This project demonstrates:

- JavaScript (Node.js) backend development
- Discord.js v14 API usage
- Event-driven architecture
- External service integration
- Configuration-first design
- Building maintainable tooling for real user communities

The codebase was written to be readable, extensible, and stable rather than overly abstract or experimental.

## Project Status

This project is considered stable and was last actively developed in early 2024.

While it still functions as intended, changes to Discord, FiveM APIs, or external dependencies may affect behaviour over time. The codebase is preserved as a complete, working system and may receive updates if required.
